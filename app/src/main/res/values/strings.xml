        <item>Have you ever seen “#name#’s World”? It’s this brand new TV show about a person who loves to #verb#. Oh, #name# loves to #verb# so much that I think it’s #adjective#! You can really tell that the producers work #adverb#. I bet they got their inspiration from that show about the #noun# that looks a lot like #name#. Anyway, I don’t think the show will make it will make it past #number# episodes, regardless of what the critics say.</item>
        <item>I am so tired! Last night I went to see that brand new #noun# at the museum. It was all going swimmingly, until the #noun# started to #verb#. Pretty soon, everyone in the room, all #number# of us, began to #verb# too. #name# was doing it especially #adverb#. It was honestly one of the most #adjective# experiences of my life. I don’t even remember leaving the museum. I woke up in #name#’s house this morning with a massive headache. How shocked I was when I saw the #noun# making us breakfast!</item>
        <item>Ever since I was #number# years old, I have always wanted to be able to #verb#. Back then, I remember #name# always telling me I’d never be able to do it. And yet, after years of practice, I can finally #verb#. Not only that, but the President gave me an award for how #adverb# I #verb#. Still, I have to use a #noun# to help me. I bet #name# is feeling pretty #adjective# now!</item>

    <string name="surpriseMadLib">My favorite memory was the day I turned #number#. It was my birthday party, and #name# was the only one there. At first I was taking it #adverb# because I thought #name# was pretty #adjective#, but then I realized that we could do something. I threw down my birthday cake and together me and #name# began to #verb#. Eventually, we found that it was a lot more fun to use a #noun#. To #verb# is truly to live.</string>
